UPGRADE GUIDE for Mason

Hints about upgrading to various major revisions of Mason. To be
completely safe, always read carefully through the Changes file and
upgrade first on a test server.

Version 1.1

- The HTML::Mason::Commands module has been removed.  None of the old
'mc_' style commands will work with this version.

Version 0.85

- Autohandlers are now recursive by default. If your site uses
directory-specific autohandlers depending on the default value of
allow_recursive_autohandlers=0, you must explicitly pass
allow_recursive_autohandlers=>0 when creating the Interp.

- All applicable autohandlers now get a chance to run. If your site
has multiple autohandlers in parent/child directories, you'll likely
get display problems when upgrading (e.g. multiple templates showing
up per page). For a short-term fix, place

    <%flags>
    inherit=>undef
    </%flags>

in every autohandler. Ideally, in the long-term you'll be able to
make the autohandlers work well together.


Version 0.8

- Version 0.8 sports a new request API. $m now contains the current
request object, and all mc_ commands have been incorporated into $m
methods. The utility bin/convert0.8.pl converts existing components to
use the new syntax. See Commands.pod for a manual conversion guide and
a list of rare conversion problems.
