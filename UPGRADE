UPGRADE GUIDE for Mason

Hints about upgrading to various major revisions of Mason. To be
completely safe, always read carefully through the Changes file and
upgrade first on a test server.

Version 1.1

- The HTML::Mason::Commands module has been removed.  None of the old
'mc_' style commands will work with this version.

- The HTML::Mason::Parser class no longer exists.  If you were
creating one with the default options in your handler.pl file, you can
remove the Parser-related code entirely.  Otherwise see the
HTML::Mason::Compiler and HTML::Mason::Compiler::ToObject
documentation for more details.

- If your handler.pl file creates an Interp object and then passes
that object to the ApacheHandler constructor, this will no longer
work.  Instead, simply pass all of the parameters for both the Interp
and ApacheHandler to the ApacheHandler constructor.

So this:

  my $interp = HTML::Mason::Interp->new( comp_root => ..., data_dir =>... );

  my $ah = HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler->new( interp => $interp );

becomes this:

  my $ah = HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler->new( comp_root => ..., data_dir =>... );

- The use_reload_file Interp parameter has been removed.  See the
documentation on the static_source parameter (in HTML::Mason::Interp),
which is intended to provide a similar performance enhancement.

- Previous versions of Mason split the POD documentation into separate
.pod files from the code, which was in .pm files.  Now, these have
been combined into one file, the .pm file.  However, perldoc will look
for a .pod file before a .pm file.

During the install, we try to find these old .pod files and delete
them.  However, if that isn't successful, you may see the old
documentation for the following modules: HTML::Mason::Interp,
HTML::Mason::Request, HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler,
HTML::Mason::Component.  If you are experiencing this problem after
installing this new version of Mason, you will need to delete the old
.pod files manually.

- The top_args and top_comp methods have been renamed to request_args
and request_comp, respectively.  The old method names have been
deprecated but will continue to work until 1.20.

- The run_count and first_time component object methods have been
removed.

- The Parser's taint_check method no longer exists in any form.  We
now automatically detect taint mode and act appropriately to untaint
component source and object files.

- The use_autohandlers, use_dhandlers, and
allow_recursive_autohandlers Interp parameters have been removed.

- The autohandler_name and dhandler_name Interp parameters no longer
accept undef as a valid value.  The upshot of these two changes is
that there is no way to "turn off" autohandlers or dhandlers.  Of
course, the "inherit" flag for components still works.

- The home-brew caching architecture, using MLDBM, has been replaced
with one that uses Cache::Cache.  The old $m->cache and $m->cache_self
methods still exist but their semantics have changed.  Please see the
Developer's Manual (HTML::Mason::Devel) and Request object docs
(HTML::Mason::Request) for more details.

- The top_level_predicate ApacheHandler parameter has been removed.
If you would like to filter requests you can do this via the new
ApacheHandler prepare_request method, which will give you a Request
object that you can manipulate before deciding to serve a request.
See the ApacheHandler docs (HTML::Mason::ApacheHandler) for more
details.

Version 0.85

- Autohandlers are now recursive by default. If your site uses
directory-specific autohandlers depending on the default value of
allow_recursive_autohandlers=0, you must explicitly pass
allow_recursive_autohandlers=>0 when creating the Interp.

- All applicable autohandlers now get a chance to run. If your site
has multiple autohandlers in parent/child directories, you'll likely
get display problems when upgrading (e.g. multiple templates showing
up per page). For a short-term fix, place

    <%flags>
    inherit=>undef
    </%flags>

in every autohandler. Ideally, in the long-term you'll be able to
make the autohandlers work well together.


Version 0.8

- Version 0.8 sports a new request API. $m now contains the current
request object, and all mc_ commands have been incorporated into $m
methods. The utility bin/convert0.8.pl converts existing components to
use the new syntax. See Commands.pod for a manual conversion guide and
a list of rare conversion problems.
