Components.pod - Mason Developer's Manual


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="description">DESCRIPTION

</A></H1>
This manual is written for content developers who know HTML and at least a
little Perl. The goal is to write, run, and debug Mason components.


<P>

If you are the webmaster (or otherwise responsible for the Mason
installation), you should also read <STRONG>HTML::Mason::Admin</STRONG>. There you will find FAQs about virtual site configuration, performance
tuning, component caching, and so on.


<P>

I strongly suggest that you have a working Mason to play with as you work
through these examples. Other component examples can be found in the <CODE>samples/</CODE> directory.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="what_are_components_">WHAT ARE COMPONENTS?

</A></H1>
The component - a mix of Perl and HTML - is Mason's basic building block
and computational unit. Under Mason, web pages are formed by combining the
output from multiple components. An article page for a news publication,
for example, might call separate components for the company masthead, ad
banner, left table of contents, and article body. Consider this layout
sketch:


<P>

<PRE>    +---------+------------------+
    |Masthead | Banner Ad        |
    +---------+------------------+
    |         |                  |
    |+-------+|Text of Article ..|
    ||       ||                  |
    ||Related||Text of Article ..|
    ||Stories||                  |
    ||       ||Text of Article ..|
    |+-------+|                  |
    |         +------------------+
    |         | Footer           |
    +---------+------------------+
</PRE>

<P>

The top level component decides the overall page layout, perhaps with HTML
tables. Individual cells are then filled by the output of subordinate
components, one for the Masthead, one for the Footer, etc. In practice
pages are built up from as few as one, to as many as twenty or more
components.


<P>

This component approach reaps many benefits in a web environment. The first
benefit is <EM>consistency</EM>: by embedding standard design elements in components, you ensure a
consistent look and make it possible to update the entire site with just a
few edits. The second benefit is <EM>concurrency</EM>: in a multi-person environment, one person can edit the masthead while
another edits the table of contents. A last benefit is <EM>reuseability</EM>: a component produced for one site might be useful on another. You can
develop a library of generally useful components to employ on your sites
and to share with others.


<P>

Most components emit chunks of HTML. ``Top level'' components, invoked from
a URL, represent an entire web page. Other, subordinate components emit
smaller bits of HTML destined for inclusion in top level components.


<P>

Components receive form and query data from HTTP requests. When called from
another component, they can accept arbitrary parameter lists just like a
subroutine, and optionally return values. This enables a type of component
that does not print any HTML, but simply serves as a function, computing
and returning a result.


<P>

Mason actually compiles components down to Perl subroutines, so you can
debug and profile component-based web pages with standard Perl tools that
understand the subroutine concept, e.g. you can use the Perl debugger to
step through components, and <STRONG>Devel::DProf</STRONG> to profile their performance.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="in_line_perl_sections">IN-LINE PERL SECTIONS 

</A></H1>
Here is a simple component example:


<P>

<PRE>    % my ($noun, $timeofday) = ('World');
    &lt;%perl&gt;
        my @time = split /[\s:]/, localtime;
        $timeofday = &quot;evening&quot;;     # default if next tests fail
        if ( $time[3] &lt; 12 ) {
            $timeofday = &quot;morning&quot;;
        } elsif ( $time[3] &gt; 12 and $time[3] &lt; 18 ) {
            $timeofday = &quot;afternoon&quot;;
        }
    &lt;/%perl&gt;
    Good &lt;% $timeofday %&gt;, &lt;% $noun %&gt;!&lt;BR&gt;
    How are ya?
</PRE>

<P>

After 6 pm, the output of this component is:


<P>

<PRE>    Good evening, World!
    How are ya?
</PRE>

<P>

This short example demonstrates the three primary in-line Perl sections you
can embed in your components. By ``in-line'' I mean these sections are
generally embedded within HTML and execute in the order they appear. Other,
specialized Perl sections are tied to component events like initialization
and cleanup, argument definition, etc. Those are covered later in <EM><A HREF="#other_perl_sections">Other Perl Sections</A></EM>.


<P>

The parsing rules for these Perl sections are as follows:


<P>

<OL>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_">

</A></STRONG>
Blocks of the form &lt;% xxx %&gt; are replaced with the result of
evaluating xxx as a single Perl expression. These are often used for
variable replacement. such as 'Hello, &lt;% <CODE>$name</CODE> %&gt;!'.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_">

</A></STRONG>
Lines beginning with a '%' character are treated as Perl. 


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_">

</A></STRONG>
Multiline blocks of Perl code can be inserted with the &lt;%perl&gt; ..
&lt;/%perl&gt; tag. The enclosed text is executed as Perl and the return
value, if any, is discarded.


<P>

The &lt;%perl&gt; tag is case-insensitive. It may appear anywhere in the
text, and may span any number of lines. &lt;%perl&gt; blocks cannot be
nested inside one another.


<P>

</OL>
I've used bad form here for the sake of example; the leading '%' line could
simply have been placed into the multi-line &lt;%perl&gt; section.


<P>

In addition to Perl code, Perl sections may also contain <EM>Mason
commands</EM>. These keywords, identified by their mc_ prefix, collectively provide an
interface to Mason services such as data caching, file includes, and so on.
The majority of Mason commands are for advanced users, but a few (like <A HREF="././Commands.html#item_mc_comp">mc_comp()</A>, for calling other components) see widespread use. <STRONG><A HREF="././Commands.html#">HTML::Mason::Commands</A></STRONG> is the reference for all Mason commands.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="how_components_are_invoked">HOW COMPONENTS ARE INVOKED

</A></H1>
Components are invoked in two ways: top-level components respond directly
to HTTP requests, while other, subordinate components are called more or
less like subroutines, using Mason's <STRONG>mc_comp</STRONG>
command. Top-level components must reside within the server's DocumentRoot,
while other components live within Mason's component root (webmasters
sometimes equate the two).


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="top_level_components">Top-level Components

</A></H2>
A top-level component is simply one that's called from an URL, such as:


<P>

<PRE>    http://www.foo.com/mktg/prods.html
</PRE>

<P>

Here, <CODE>prods.html</CODE> may be nothing more than a static HTML file, since components don't <EM>have</EM> to contain any Mason stuff.


<P>

Now consider a CGI-style URL with a few GET parameters attached:


<P>

<PRE>    http://www.foo.com/mktg/prods.html?str=dog&amp;lst=2&amp;lst=3&amp;lst=4
</PRE>

<P>

This component must now contain some Mason elements in order to read the
query arguments and do something interesting with them. To read the
arguments, prods.html should contain a <CODE>&lt;%perl_args%&gt;</CODE>
section (see <EM><A HREF="#parameter_passing">Parameter Passing</A></EM> below) describing the input variables and their data types, in this case a
scalar (<CODE>$str</CODE>) and a three-element list (<CODE>@lst</CODE>). Thus components are relieved of the form-parsing chores common to CGI
scripts.


<P>

A catch-all <CODE>%ARGS</CODE> hash is also available for components that
wish to deal with HTTP request arguments directly. <CODE>%ARGS</CODE> is
defined automatically; components need not list it in a
<CODE>&lt;%perl_args%&gt;</CODE> section.


<P>

These arguments are subsequently available to the component as regular Perl
variables.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="dhandlers">dhandlers

</A></H2>
What happens when a user requests a component that doesn't exist? In this
case Mason scans backward through the URI, checking each directory for a
component named <EM>dhandler</EM> (``default handler''). If found, the dhandler is invoked and is expected to
use
<CODE>$r-&gt;path_info</CODE> (the virtual location) as the parameter to some access function, perhaps a
database lookup or location in another filesystem. In a sense, dhandlers
are similar in spirit to Perl's AUTOLOAD feature; they are the ``component
of last resort'' when a URL points to a non-existent component.


<P>

Consider the following URL, in which <CODE>newsfeeds/</CODE> exists but not the subdirectory <CODE>LocalNews</CODE> nor the component <CODE>locStory1.html</CODE>:


<P>

<PRE>    http://myserver/newsfeeds/LocalNews/locStory1.html,
</PRE>

<P>

In this case Mason constructs the following search path:


<P>

<PRE>    /newsfeeds/LocalNews/locStory1.htm  =&gt; no such thing
    /newsfeeds/LocalNews/dhandler       =&gt; no such thing
    /newsfeeds/dhandler                 =&gt; found! (search ends)
    /dhandler
</PRE>

<P>

The found dhandler would read ``/LocalNews/locStory1.html'' from
<CODE>$r-&gt;path_info</CODE> and use it as a retrieval key. Optionally, the Mason command <A HREF="././Commands.html#item_mc_dhandler_arg">mc_dhandler_arg()</A> returns the same path_info stripped of the leading slash
(``LocalNews/locStory1.html''). This is sometimes more useful that the
absolute path returned by <CODE>$r-&gt;path_info</CODE>.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="components_as_subroutines">Components as Subroutines

</A></H2>
Components typically build themselves up from other components--this is in
fact the keystone of Mason's component-based approach. Good components
therefore resemble good subroutines in that they're written for reuse.


<P>

To call one component from another, use Mason's <STRONG>mc_comp</STRONG> command:


<P>

<STRONG>mc_comp (compPath, name=</STRONG>&gt;<STRONG>value, ...[, STORE=</STRONG>&gt;<STRONG>ref ])</STRONG>




<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_compPath_">compPath:

</A></STRONG><DD>
The component path. With a leading '/', the path is relative to the
component root (<A HREF="././Interp.html#item_comp_root">comp_root</A>). Otherwise, it is relative to the location of the calling component.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_name_value_pairs_">name=&gt;value pairs:

</A></STRONG><DD>
Parameters are passed as one or more name=&gt;value pairs, e.g. <CODE>player=&gt;'M.&nbsp;Jordan'</CODE>. 


<P>

The optional <EM>STORE</EM> parameter takes a scalar reference as an argument, and tells the component
to direct its output into the named variable instead of standard output
(programmers: think sprintf vs. printf). For example:


<P>

<PRE>    &lt;% mc_comp('/shared/mastHead', color=&gt;'salmon',
                                   STORE=&gt;\$mh_text) %&gt;
</PRE>

<P>

</DL>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="parameter_passing">Parameter Passing

</A></H2>
Any Perl data type can be passed in an <CODE>mc_comp()</CODE> call:


<P>

<PRE>    mc_comp('/mktg/prods.html', s=&gt;'dog', l=&gt;[2,3,4], h=&gt;{a=&gt;7,b=&gt;8});
</PRE>

<P>

This command passes a scalar ($s), a list (@l), and a hash (%h). The list
and hash must be passed as references, but in /mktg/prods.html they are
automatically dereferenced into a local list and hash. While convenient,
this means that <CODE>@b</CODE> and <CODE>%c</CODE> are copies--changing
them does not modify the caller's version. To pass a reference, declare it
as a scalar value.


<P>

Unlike Perl subroutines, Mason components <EM>do not</EM> read their parameters from Perl's <CODE>@_</CODE> array. Rather, Mason
imposes its own typed argument passing protocol in which components define
a
<CODE>&lt;%perl_args%&gt;</CODE> section listing parameter names, types, and default values. For example:


<P>

<PRE>    &lt;%perl_args&gt;
    $a
    @b
    %c
    $d=&gt;5
    @e=&gt;('foo','baz')
    %f=&gt;(joe=&gt;1,bob=&gt;2)
    &lt;/%perl_args&gt;
</PRE>

<P>

Here, $a, @b, and <CODE>%c</CODE> are required arguments; the component
generates an error if the caller leaves them unspecified. $d, @e, and
<CODE>%f</CODE> are optional arguments; they are assigned the specified
default values if unspecified.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="return_values_and_context">Return Values and Context

</A></H2>
Components generally fall into one of two categories: HTML generators, and
functions that compute a value. The latter behave like normal Perl
functions, while HTML generators (far more common), rarely return
values--in the name of performance they stream their output immediately to
the browser.


<P>

Mason in fact adds a <CODE>return undef</CODE> to the bottom of each component to provide an empty default return value.
For HTML-generating components, this allows the convenient idiom:


<P>

<PRE>    &lt;% mc_comp('foo') %&gt;
</PRE>

<P>

which, if you think about it, actually prints two things: foo internally
prints some HTML, while <CODE>&lt;%mc_comp('foo')%&gt;</CODE>
prints the return value of foo (<CODE>undef</CODE>).


<P>

To return your own value from a component, you <EM>must</EM> use an explicit <CODE>return</CODE> statement. In this case the component behaves like a normal Perl subroutine
with regard to return values and scalar/list context:


<P>

<PRE>    You are &lt;% mc_comp('isNetscape') ? '' : 'NOT' %&gt; using Netscape!
</PRE>

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="other_perl_sections">OTHER PERL SECTIONS

</A></H1>
The Perl sections we're about to describe are more specialized than the
in-line sections described above. Several are tied to phases of the
component execution sequence, which goes something like this:


<P>

<PRE>    1. Initialize arguments in HTML::Mason::Commands package
    2. &lt;%perl_init%&gt; section
    3. Output HTTP headers (if not output already)
    4. Primary section (HTML + embedded Perl sections)
    5. &lt;%perl_cleanup%&gt; section
</PRE>

<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__perl_init_xxx_perl_init_">&lt;%perl_init&gt; xxx &lt;/%perl_init&gt;

</A></STRONG><DD>
Used for initialization code. For example: connecting to a database and
selecting out rows; opening a file and reading its contents into a list.


<P>

Technically a &lt;%perl_init&gt; block is equivalent to a &lt;%perl&gt;
block at the beginning of the component. However, there is an aesthetic
advantage of placing this block at the end of the component rather than the
beginning. In the following example, a database query is used to preload
the <CODE>@persons</CODE> list-of-hashes; it lets us hide the technical
details at the bottom.


<P>

<PRE>    &lt;H2&gt;Birthdays Next Week&lt;/H2&gt;
    &lt;TABLE BORDER=1&gt;
    &lt;TR&gt;&lt;TH&gt;Name&lt;/TH&gt;&lt;TH&gt;Birthday&lt;/TH&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
    % foreach (@persons) {
        &lt;TR&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;%$_-&gt;{name}%&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;TD&gt;&lt;%$_-&gt;{birthday}%&gt;&lt;/TD&gt;&lt;/TR&gt;
    % }
    &lt;/TABLE&gt;
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    &lt;%PERL_INIT&gt;
    # Assuming DBI/DBD and Date::Manip are already loaded ...
    # Query MySQL for employees with birthdays next week.
    # Results are stored in the @persons list-of-hashes.
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    my (@persons, $name, $birthday);    # local vars
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    # Calculate &quot;MM-DD&quot; dates for this and next Sunday
    my $Sun = UnixDate(&amp;ParseDate(&quot;Sunday&quot;), &quot;%m-%d&quot;);
    my $nextSun = UnixDate(&amp;DateCalc(&quot;Sunday&quot;, &quot;+7 days&quot;), &quot;%m-%d&quot;);
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    my $dbh = DBI-&gt;connect('DBI:mysql:myDB', 'nobody' );
    my $sth = $dbh-&gt;prepare(
       qq{ SELECT name, DATE_FORMAT(birthday, 'm-d')
           FROM emp
           WHERE DATE_FORMAT(birthday,'m-d') BETWEEN '$Sun' AND '$nextSun'
         } );
    $sth-&gt;execute;              # other DBDs want this after the bind
    $sth-&gt;bind_columns(undef, \($name, $birthday) );
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    while ($sth-&gt;fetch) {
        push (@persons, {name=&gt;$name, birthday=&gt;$birthday} );
    }
    &lt;/%PERL_INIT&gt;
</PRE>

<P>

Since <CODE>&lt;%perl_init&gt;</CODE> sections fire before any HTTP headers are sent, they should do their work
quickly to prevent dead time on the browser side.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__perl_cleanup_xxx_perl_clea">&lt;%perl_cleanup&gt; xxx &lt;/%perl_cleanup&gt;

</A></STRONG><DD>
Useful for cleanup code. For example: closing a database connection or
closing a file handle.


<P>

Technically a &lt;%perl_cleanup&gt; block is equivalent to a &lt;%perl&gt;
block at the end of the component, but has aesthetic value as marking a
cleanup section.


<P>

Recall that the end of a component corresponds to the end of a subroutine
block. Since Perl is so darned good at cleaning up stuff at the end of
blocks, &lt;%perl_cleanup&gt; sections are rarely needed.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__perl_args_xxx_perl_args_">&lt;%perl_args&gt; xxx &lt;/%perl_args&gt;

</A></STRONG><DD>
xxx contains a list of argument declarations, one per line. Each
declaration contains a type character ($, @, or %), a name, and optionally
'=&gt;' followed by a default value. The default value must be a valid Perl
expression of matching type (scalar, list, hash).


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__at_end_of_line">\ at end of line

</A></STRONG><DD>
Useful for suppressing unwanted newlines before Perl lines and block tags.
In HTML components, this is mostly useful for fixed width areas like
&lt;PRE&gt; tags, since browsers ignore white space for the most part. An
example:


<P>

<PRE>    &lt;PRE&gt;
    foo
    %if ($b == 2) {
    bar
    %}
    baz
    &lt;/PRE&gt;
</PRE>

<P>

outputs


<P>

<PRE>    foo
    bar
    baz
</PRE>

<P>

because of the newlines on lines 1 and 3. (Lines 2 and 4 do not generate a
newline because the entire line is taken by Perl.) To suppress the
newlines:


<P>

<PRE>    &lt;PRE&gt;
    foo\
    %if ($b == 2) {
    bar\
    %}
    baz
    &lt;/PRE&gt;
</PRE>

<P>

which prints


<P>

<PRE>    foobarbaz
</PRE>

<P>

The backslash has no special meaning outside this context. In particular,
you cannot use it to escape a newline before a plain text line.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__perl_doc_xxx_perl_doc_">&lt;%perl_doc&gt; xxx &lt;/%perl_doc&gt;

</A></STRONG><DD>
Most useful for a component's main documentation. One can easily write a
program to sift through a set of components and pull out their
&lt;%perl_doc&gt; blocks to form a reference page.


<P>

Can also be used for in-line comments, though I admit it is a somewhat
cumbersome comment marker. Another option is '%#':


<P>

<PRE>    %# this is a comment
</PRE>

<P>

These comments differ from HTML comments in that they do not appear in the
HTML.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item__perl_off_">&lt;%perl_off&gt;

</A></STRONG><DD>
Turns off processing of Perl sections; useful when documenting Mason itself
from a component:


<P>

<PRE>    &lt;%perl_off&gt;
    % This is an example of a Perl line.
    &lt;% This is an example of an expression block. %&gt;
    &lt;/%perl_off&gt;
</PRE>

<P>

This works for almost everything, but doesn't let you output &lt;/%perl_off&gt; itself! When all else fails, use <A HREF="././Commands.html#item_mc_out">mc_out()</A>:


<P>

<PRE>    %mc_out('The tags are &lt;%perl_off&gt; and &lt;/%perl_off&gt;.');
</PRE>

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="examples_and_recommended_usage">EXAMPLES AND RECOMMENDED USAGE

</A></H1>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="_lines">% lines

</A></H2>
Most useful for conditional and loop structures - if, while, foreach, ,
etc. - as well as side-effect commands like assignments. Examples:


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Conditional_code">Conditional code

</A></STRONG><DD>
<PRE>    % my $ua = $r-&gt;header_in('User-Agent');

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="_xxx_"><% xxx %>

</A></H2>
Most useful for printing out variables, as well as more complex

<H1><A NAME="data_caching">DATA CACHING

</A></H1>
Mason's <A HREF="././Commands.html#item_mc_cache">mc_cache()</A> and <A HREF="././Commands.html#item_mc_cache_self">mc_cache_self()</A> commands let components save and retrieve the results of computation for
improved performance. Anything may be cached, from a block of HTML to a
complex data structure.


<P>

Each component gets a private data cache. Except under special
circumstances, one component does not access another component's cache.
Each cached value may be set to expire under certain conditions or at a
certain time.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="basic_usage">Basic Usage

</A></H2>
Here's the typical usage of mc_cache:


<P>

<PRE>  my $result = mc_cache(action=&gt;'retrieve');
  if (!defined($result)) {
      ... compute $result&gt; ...
      mc_cache(action=&gt;'store', value=&gt;$result);
  }
</PRE>

<P>

The first mc_cache call attempts to retrieve this component's cache value.
If the value is available it is placed in <CODE>$result</CODE>. If the value is not available, <CODE>$result</CODE> is computed and stored in the cache by the second mc_cache call.


<P>

The default action for mc_cache is 'retrieve', so the first line can be
written as


<P>

<PRE>  my $result = mc_cache();
</PRE>

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="multiple_keys_values">Multiple Keys/Values

</A></H2>
A cache file can store multiple keys and values. A value can be a scalar,
list reference, or hash reference:


<P>

<PRE>  mc_cache(action=&gt;'store',key=&gt;'name',value=&gt;$name);
  mc_cache(action=&gt;'store',key=&gt;'friends',value=&gt;\@lst);
  mc_cache(action=&gt;'store',key=&gt;'map',value=&gt;\%hsh);
</PRE>

<P>

The key defaults to 'main' when unspecified, as in the first example above.


<P>

Mason uses the <STRONG>MLDBM</STRONG> package to store and retrieve from its cache files, meaning that Mason can
cache arbitrarily deep data structures composed of lists, hashes, and
simple scalars.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="expiration">Expiration

</A></H2>
Typical cache items have a useful lifetime after which they must expire.
Mason supports three types of expiration:


<P>

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_By_Time">By Time

</A></STRONG><DD>
(e.g. the item expires in an hour, or at midnight). To expire an item by
time, pass one of these options to the 'store' action.


<P>

<EM>expire_at</EM>: takes an absolute expiration time, in Perl <CODE>time()</CODE> format
(number of seconds since the epoch)


<P>

<EM>expire_in</EM>: takes a relative expiration time of the form ``&lt;num&gt;&lt;unit&gt;'',
where &lt;num&gt; is a positive number and &lt;unit&gt; is one of seconds,
minutes, hours, days, or weeks, or any abbreviation thereof. E.g.
``10min'', ``1hour''.


<P>

<EM>expire_next</EM>: takes a string, either 'hour' or 'day'. It indicates an expiration time
at the top of the next hour or day.


<P>

Examples:


<P>

<PRE>    mc_cache(action=&gt;'store', expire_in=&gt;'2 hours');
    mc_cache(action=&gt;'store', expire_next=&gt;'hour');
</PRE>

<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_By_Condition">By Condition

</A></STRONG><DD>
(e.g. the item expires if a certain file or database table changes). To
expire an item based on events rather than current time, pass the
'expire_if' option to the 'retrieve' action.


<P>

<EM>expire_if</EM>: calls a given anonymous subroutine and expires if the subroutine returns
a non-zero value. The subroutine is called with one parameter, the time
when the cache value was last written.


<P>

Example:


<P>

<PRE>    # expire the cache if 'myfile' is newer
    mc_cache(action =&gt; 'retrieve',
          expire_if =&gt; sub { [stat 'myfile']-&gt;[9] &gt; $_[0] });
</PRE>

<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_By_Explicit_Action">By Explicit Action

</A></STRONG><DD>
(e.g. a shell command or web interface is responsible for explicitly
expiring the item) To expire an item from a Perl script, for any component,
use <STRONG>access_data_cache</STRONG>. It takes the same arguments as mc_cache plus one additional argument,
cache_file. See the administration manual for details on where cache files
are stored and how they are named.


<P>

<PRE>    use HTML::Mason::Utils 'access_data_cache';
    access_data_cache (cache_file=&gt;'/usr/local/mason/cache/foo::bar',
                       action=&gt;'expire' [, key=&gt;'fookey']);
</PRE>

<P>

</DL>
<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="keeping_in_memory">Keeping In Memory

</A></H2>
The keep_in_memory flag indicates that the cache value should be kept in
memory after it is stored or retrieved. Since every child process will
store its own copy, this flag should be used only for small, frequently
retrieved cache values. If used, this flag should be passed to both the
store and retrieve commands.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H2><A NAME="caching_all_output">Caching All Output 

</A></H2>
Occasionally you will need to cache the complete output of a component. One
way to accomplish this is to replace the component with a placeholder that
simply calls the component, then caches and prints the result. For example,
if the component were named ``foo'', we might rename it to ``foo_main'' and
put this component in its place:


<P>

<PRE>    &lt;% $foo_out %&gt;
    &lt;%perl_init&gt;
        my $foo_out;
        if (!defined ($foo_out = mc_cache())) {
            mc_comp('foo_main', STORE=&gt;\$foo_out);
            mc_cache(action=&gt;'store',
                  expire_in=&gt;'3 hours', value=&gt;$foo_out);
        }
    &lt;/%perl_init&gt;
</PRE>

<P>

This works, but is cumbersome. Mason offers a better shortcut: the
<STRONG>mc_cache_self()</STRONG> command that lets a component cache it's own output and eliminates the need
for a dummy component. It is typically used right at the top of a <CODE>&lt;%perl_init%&gt;</CODE> section:


<P>

<PRE>    ... &lt;primary section, body of page&gt; ...
    &lt;%perl_init&gt;
        return if mc_cache_self(expire_in=&gt;'3 hours'[, key=&gt;'fookey']);
        ... &lt;rest of perl_init&gt; ...
    &lt;/%perl_init%&gt;
</PRE>

<P>

<STRONG>mc_cache_self</STRONG> is built on top of <STRONG>mc_cache</STRONG>, so it inherits all the expiration options described earlier.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="accessing_server_internals">ACCESSING SERVER INTERNALS

</A></H1>
Mason is built on top of mod_perl, an Apache extension that embeds a
persistent Perl interpreter into the web server. Mason makes the powerful <CODE>$r</CODE> ``request object'' available as a global in all components, granting access
to a variety of server internals, HTTP request data, and server API
methods.


<P>

<CODE>$r</CODE> is fully described in the Apache documentation -- here is a sampling of
methods useful to component developers:


<P>

<PRE>    $r-&gt;uri             # the HTTP request URI
    $r-&gt;headers_in(..)  # the named HTTP header line
    $r-&gt;server-&gt;port    # (note two arrows!) port # (usu. 80)
    $r-&gt;content_type    # set or retrieve content-type
</PRE>

<P>

<PRE>    $r-&gt;content()       # don't use this one! (see Tips and Traps)
</PRE>

<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="sending_http_headers">SENDING  HTTP HEADERS

</A></H1>
Mason sends a standard HTTP header with content type text/html when it
reaches the primary HTML section of a component (after any
<CODE>&lt;%perl_init&gt;</CODE> section).


<P>

That means if you want to send your own HTTP header, you have to do it in
the <CODE>&lt;%perl_init%&gt;</CODE> section. You send headers with Apache commands headers_out and
send_http_header.


<P>

To prevent Mason from sending out the default header, call
<A HREF="././Commands.html#item_mc_suppress_http_header">mc_suppress_http_header(1)</A>. Here's an example:


<P>

<PRE>    &lt;%perl_init&gt;
    ...
    mc_suppress_http_header(1);   # necessary because of next line
    my $registered = mc_comp('isUserRegistered');
    if (!$registered) {
         mc_comp('/shared/http/redirect',url=&gt;'/registerScreen');
    }
    ...
    &lt;/%perl_init&gt;
</PRE>

<P>

The component isUserRegistered returns 0 or 1 indicating whether the user
has registered (e.g. by looking for a cookie). If the result is 0, we use
an HTTP redirect to go to the registration screen. Mason would normally
send the default header upon reaching the primary section of
isUserRegistered - that is why we must call mc_suppress_http_header.


<P>

To cancel header suppression, call <CODE>mc_suppress_http_header(0).</CODE> 


<P>

<H1><A NAME="using_the_perl_debugger">USING THE PERL DEBUGGER

</A></H1>
The Perl debugger is an indispensable tool for identifying and fixing bugs
in Perl programs. Unfortunately, in a mod_perl environment one is normally
unable to use the debugger since programs are run from a browser. Mason
removes this limitation by optionally creating a <EM>debug
file</EM> for each page request, allowing the request to be replayed from the command
line or Perl debugger.


<P>

Here is a typical sequence for debugging a Mason page:


<P>

<OL>
<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_Find_the_debug_file_"> Find the debug file:

</A></STRONG>
When Mason is running in debug mode, requests generate ``debug files'',
cycling through filenames ``1'' through ``20''. To find a request's debug
file, simply do a ``View Source'' in your browser after the request and
look for a comment like this at the very top:


<P>

<PRE>    &lt;!--
    Debug file is '3'.
    Full debug path is '/usr/local/mason/debug/anon/3'.
    --&gt;
</PRE>

<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_Run_the_debug_file_"> Run the debug file:

</A></STRONG>
Debug files basically contain two things: a copy of the entire HTTP request
(serialized with <STRONG>Data::Dumper</STRONG>), and all the plumbing needed to route that request through Mason. In
other words, if you simply run the debug file like this:


<P>

<PRE>    perl /usr/local/mason/debug/anon/3
</PRE>

<P>

you should see the HTTP headers and content that the component would
normally send to the browser.


<P>

<LI><STRONG><A NAME="item_Debug_the_debug_file_"> Debug the debug file:

</A></STRONG>
Now you merely add a <CODE>-d</CODE> option to run the debug file in Perl's debugger -- at which point you have
to deal the problem of anonymous subroutines.


<P>

Mason compiles components down to anonymous subroutines which are not
easily breakpoint'able (Perl prefers line numbers or named subroutines).
Therefore, immediately before each component call, Mason calls a nonce
subroutine called <CODE>debug_hook</CODE> just so you can breakpoint it like this:


<P>

<PRE>    b HTML::Mason::Interp::debug_hook
</PRE>

<P>

Since debug_hook is called with the component name as the second parameter,
you can also breakpoint specific components using a conditional on $_[1]:


<P>

<PRE>    b HTML::Mason::Interp::debug_hook $_[1] =~ /component name/
</PRE>

<P>

You can avoid all that typing by adding the following to your ~/.perldb
file:


<P>

<PRE>    # Perl debugger aliases for Mason
    $DB::alias{mb} = 's/^mb\b/b HTML::Mason::Interp::debug_hook/';
</PRE>

<P>

which reduces the previous examples to just: 


<P>

<PRE>    mb
    mb $_[1] =~ /component name/
</PRE>

<P>

</OL>
The use of debug files opens lots of other debugging options. For instance,
you can read a debug file into the Emacs editor, with its nifty interface
to Perl's debugger. This allows you to set break points visually or (in
trace mode) watch a cursor bounce through your code in single-step or
continue mode.


<P>

Details about configuring debug mode can be found in
<STRONG><A HREF="././Admin.html#">HTML::Mason::Admin</A></STRONG>. In particular, the administrator must decide which of three debugging
modes to activate:


<P>

<STRONG>never</STRONG> (no debug files)


<P>

<STRONG>always</STRONG> (create debug files for each request)


<P>

<STRONG>error</STRONG> (only generate a debug file when an error occurs)


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="using_the_perl_profiler_new_in_">USING THE PERL PROFILER (new in 0.4)

</A></H1>
Debug files, mentioned in the previous section, can be used in conjunction
with Devel::DProf to profile a web request.


<P>

To use profiling, pass the <CODE>-p</CODE> flag to the debug file:


<P>

<PRE>    % ./3 -p
</PRE>

<P>

This executes the debug file under Devel::DProf and, for convenience, runs
dprofpp. If you wish you can rerun dprofpp with your choice of options.


<P>

Because components are implemented as anonymous subroutines, any time spent
in components would normally be reported under an unreadable label like
<CODE>CODE(0xb6cbc).</CODE> To remedy this, the <CODE>-p</CODE> flag automatically adjusts the tmon.out file so that components are
reported by their component paths.


<P>

Much of the time spent in a typical debug file is initialization, such as
loading Mason and other Perl modules. The effects of initialization can
swamp profile results and obscure the time actually spent in components.
One remedy is to run multiple iterations of the request inside the debug
file, thus reducing the influence of initialization time. Pass the number
of desired iterations via the <CODE>-r</CODE>
flag:


<P>

<PRE>    % ./3 -p -r20
</PRE>

<P>

Currently there are no special provisions for other profiling modules such
as Devel::SmallProf. You can try simply:


<P>

<PRE>    % perl -d:SmallProf ./3 -r20
</PRE>

<P>

However, this crashes on our Unix system -- apparently some bad interaction
between Mason and SmallProf -- so it is unsupported for now.


<P>

<P>
<HR>
<H1><A NAME="the_previewer">THE PREVIEWER

</A></H1>
Mason comes with a web-based debugging utility that lets you test your
components by throwing fake requests at them. Adjustable parameters
include: UserAgent, Time, HTTP Referer, O/S and so on. For example, imagine
a component whose color scheme is supposed to change each morning, noon,
and night. Using the Previewer, it would be simple to set the perceived
time forward 1,5 or 8 hours to test the component at various times of day.


<P>

The Previewer also provides a debug trace of a page, showing all components
being called and indicating the portion of HTML each component is
responsible for. For pages constructed from more than a few components,
these traces are quite useful for finding the component that is outputting
a particular piece of HTML.


<P>

Your administrator will give you the main Previewer URL, and a set of
preview ports that you will use to view your site under various conditions.
For the purpose of this discussion we'll assume the Previewer is up and
working, that the Previewer URL is <A
HREF="http://www.yoursite.com/preview,">http://www.yoursite.com/preview,</A>
and the preview ports are 3001 to 3005.


<P>

Take a look at the main Previewer page. The top part contains the most
frequently used options, such as time and display mode. The middle part
contains a table of your saved configurations; if this is your first time
using the Previewer, it will be empty. The bottom part contains less
frequently used options, such as setting the user agent and referer.


<P>

Try clicking ``Save''. This will save the displayed settings under the
chosen preview port, say 3001, and redraw the page. Under ``Saved Port
Settings'', you should see a single row showing this configuration. Your
configurations are saved permanently in a file. If a username/password is
required to access the Previewer, then each user has his/her own
configuration file.


<P>

The ``View'' button should display your site's home page. If not, then the
Previewer may not be set up correctly; contact your administrator or see
the Administrator's Manual.


<P>

Go back to the main Previewer page, change the display mode from ``HTML''
to ``debug'', change the preview port to 3002, and click ``Save'' again.
You should now see a second saved configuration.


<P>

Click ``View''. This time instead of seeing the home page as HTML, you'll
get a debug trace with several sections. The first section shows a numbered
hierarchy of components used to generate this page. The second section is
the HTML source, with each line annotated on the left with the number of
the component that generated it. Try clicking on the numbers in the first
section; this brings you to the place in the second section where that
component first appears. If there's a particular piece of HTML you want to
change on a page, searching in the annotated source will let you quickly
determine which component is responsible.


<P>

The final section of the debug page shows input and output HTTP headers.
Note that some of these are simulated due to your Previewer settings. For
example, if you specified a particular user agent in your Previewer
configuration, then the User-Agent header is simulated; otherwise it
reflects your actual browser.

<DL>
<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_No_Subroutines">No Subroutines

</A></STRONG><DD>
Do not declare named subroutines within your components. Mason wraps your
subroutine within its own <CODE>sub {..}</CODE>, which creates a subroutine within a subroutine, which makes Perl very
unhappy. Instead, use local anonymous subroutines or create another
component and call with <STRONG>mc_comp</STRONG>.


<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Do_Not_Call_r_content_or_new_">Do Not Call $r-&gt;content or ''new CGI``

</A></STRONG><DD>
Mason calls <CODE>$r-&gt;content</CODE> itself to read request input, emptying the input buffer and leaving a trap
for the unwary: subsequent calls to <CODE>$r-&gt;content</CODE> hang the server. This is a mod_perl ``feature'' that may be fixed in an
upcoming release.


<P>

For the same reason you should not create a CGI object like


<P>

<PRE>  my $query = new CGI;
</PRE>

<P>

when handling a POST; the CGI module will try to reread request input and
hang. Instead, create an empty object:


<P>

<PRE>  my $query = new CGI (&quot;&quot;);
</PRE>

<P>

such an object can still be used for all of CGI's useful HTML output
functions. Or, if you really want to use CGI's input functions, initialize
the object from %ARGS:


<P>

<PRE>  my $query = new CGI (%ARGS);
</PRE>

<P>

<DT><STRONG><A NAME="item_Separating_Perl_From_HTML">Separating Perl From HTML

</A></STRONG><DD>
In our experience, the most readable components, especially for
non-programmer designers and editors, contain full HTML in one continuous
block at the top with simple substitutions for dynamic elements
(&lt;%$name%&gt;, &lt;%$salary%&gt;) but no distracting blocks of Perl
code. At the bottom a &lt;%perl_init&gt; block sets up the substitution
variables -- getting <CODE>$name</CODE> from the database, calculating
$salary, etc. This organization allows non-programmers to work with the
HTML without getting distracted or discouraged by Perl code.


<P>

This technique does sacrifice some performance for readability.
