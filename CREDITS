CREDITS for Mason

The original idea for Mason was inspired by the component system used
by NetGuide Live at CMP Media in 1996.  HTML++ lives on!

Gady Costeff (costeff@yahoo.com) formulated the need for a better
component-based web engine and blessed us with a creative, open-minded
environment.

Tom Smith (tsmith@cmp.com) protected our core development team from
hostile forces, kept calm during the storms, and was (and continues to
be) a great ally of the Mason open source initiative.

Thanks to Debra Robinson and CMP management for generously supporting
the Mason and Content Management open source releases.

Chris Dobosz (chris@mojam.com) helped design the predecessor to Mason
(Scribe) and implemented the predecessor to Content Management system.
He had the first non-CMP production web site to use Mason, Mojam.com.

Dennis Watson (dwatson@cmp.com) also helped design Scribe and was a
never-ending source of Perl and Oracle wisdom.

Kurt Hurtado (kurt@kind.com) helped convert Scribe to Mason and
created the CD-ME example.

Mark Schmick (mark@webz.com) wrote all of the original Mason
documentation and helped greatly in getting the first release out the
door.  He also created the Mason Content Management system.  Mark is a
fellow Perl-worshipper and my programming alter ego if there ever was
one.

Patrick Kane (modus@pr.es.to) was an early Mason adopter providing
useful feedback from the beginning.  He has suggested and implemented
numerous features.

Kirrily 'Skud' Robert (skud@netizen.com.au) started the Mason mailing
list despite my foot-dragging, and I'm eternally grateful.

Matt Jalbert (mjalbert@exuberance.com) lent his artistic flair to
the MasonHQ web site design.

Gordon Henriksen (gordon@actifunds.com) did some preliminary work on a
new lexer and compiler for Mason.  We stole the general design concept
and many code snippets.

The Internet technology team at CMP was supportive and patient with me
as I brought down the systems with my periodic Mason "improvements".
