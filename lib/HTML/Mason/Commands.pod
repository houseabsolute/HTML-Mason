HTML::Mason::Commands - Mason command reference

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The following commands may be used within Mason components. See
B<HTML::Mason::Components> (the I<Mason Developer's Guide>), for usage
examples.

=head1 COMMAND REFERENCE

=over

=item mc_abort ([return value])

Ends the current execution, finishing the page without returning
through components. In a web environment, the optional return value is
used as the HTTP status code.

=item mc_cache ([action=>'retrieve'], [key=>name],
[keep_in_memory=>0|1], [expire_if=>sub])

=item mc_cache (action=>'store', [key=>name], value=>data,
[keep_in_memory=>0|1], [expire_at=>time | expire_next=>'hour'|'day' |
expire_in=>delta])

=item mc_cache (action=>'expire', [key=>name])

mc_cache() lets you store and retrieve the results
of computation for improved performance. Each component has its own
data cache for storing one or more key/value pairs. The cache is
implemented as a DBM database. See the L<Components/data caching>
section of the I<Component Developer's Guide> for examples
and caching strategies.

The argument to I<action> is one of:

o I<retrieve>: returns the cache value if successful, or C<undef>
if there was no value or if it has expired.

o I<store>: stores a new cache value under the given key.
Default key is 'main'.

o I<expire>: expires a given cache value or values.
key may be a single key or a list reference. Default key is 'main'.

o I<keys>: returns a list of all the keys in the cache.

I<value> defines what to store. It can be a scalar or a reference to
an arbitrary data structure. The allowable size depends on your DBM
implementation.

I<keep_in_memory> indicates whether to save the value in memory once it is
retrieved. Default is 0, meaning that the value will be retrieved from
the cache file each time. If 1, each child server that retrieves this
value will save its own copy, which can result in substantial memory
usage for larger values. Use sparingly.

The various expiration options are:

o I<expire_at>: takes an absolute expiration time, in Perl time() format
(number of seconds since the epoch)

o I<expire_in>: takes a relative expiration time of the form
"<num><unit>", where <num> is a positive number and <unit> is one of
seconds, minutes, hours, days, or weeks, or any abbreviation thereof.
E.g. "10min", "30m", "1hour".

o I<expire_next>: takes a string, either 'hour' or 'day'. It indicates
an expiration time at the top of the next hour or day.

o I<expire_if>: calls a given anonymous subroutine and expires if the
subroutine returns a non-zero value. The subroutine is called with one
parameter, the time when the cache value was last written.

=item mc_cache_self ([key=>name], [keep_in_memory=>0|1],
B<[expire_if=E<gt>sub | expire_at=E<gt>time |
expire_next=E<gt>'hour'|'day' | expire_in=E<gt>delta])>

Uses mc_cache to cache the entire output of the current component.  It is typically
used right at the top of a C<E<lt>%perl_init%E<gt>> section:

    <%perl_init>
        return if mc_cache_self(expire_in=>'3 hours'[, key=>'fookey']);
        ... <rest of perl_init> ...
    </%perl_init>

The "return if" is necessary. mc_cache_self handles both the retrieve
and store, so you can pass both kinds of options to it. See
mc_cache for an explanation of options.

mc_cache_self uses a bit of magic to accomplish everything in one
line.  You don't really need to understand this, but if you're
curious, here's how it works:

o A component foo calls mc_cache_self for the first time.

o mc_cache_self sees that the cache is empty and calls foo again
recursively, with a STORE option to capture its content into a buffer.

o foo again calls mc_cache_self; this time it returns 0 immediately.

o foo goes about its business and generates content into the mc_cache_self buffer.

o When control is returned to mc_cache_self, it stores the content in
the cache and also outputs the content normally.  Finally
mc_cache_self returns 1, which in turn causes foo to return
immediately.

=item mc_caller ()

Returns the full path of the component that called this component, or
undef if this is the top-level component. This is the second element
of mc_comp_stack.

=item mc_comp (compPath, option=>value, ...[, STORE=>ref])

Calls the component designated by I<compPath> with the specified
option/value pairs. If the component path is absolute (starting with a
'/'), then the component is found relative to the component root.
Relative component paths (no leading '/') are relative to the current component
directory.

Components work exactly like Perl subroutines in terms of return
values and context. A component can return any type of value, which is
then returned from the mc_comp call.

If you want to capture the output of a component in a string, send a
scalar reference with the STORE option. The output will be placed in
the scalar instead of being sent to the default output stream.

=item mc_comp_exists (compPath)

Returns 1 if compPath is a valid component path, 0 otherwise. 

=item mc_comp_stack ()

Returns the list of components in the call stack, starting with the
current component and ending with the top-level component.

=item mc_date (format)

This command is provided for backward compatibility with early
versions of Mason that automatically used the Date::Manip package.
Returns the interpreter's notion of the current time or date in the
specified format. This works like Date::Manip::UnixDate (see
B<Date::Manip> for valid formats). To use this command you must now
explicitly "use Date::Manip" inside the HTML::Mason::Commands package.
E.g. in your handler.pl,

    { package HTML::Mason::Commands;
      use Date::Manip; }

To allow time and date simulations in the previewer, components should
use mc_date() rather than UnixDate directly.

mc_date() works faster than UnixDate for some formats by caching results. 

=item mc_file (filename)

Returns the contents of filename as a string. I<filename> may be an
absolute filesystem path (starting with a '/') or relative (no
leading '/'); if relative, the static file root is prepended.

Developers are encouraged to use relative paths whenever possible.
This eliminates the need for component updates when data files are
moved (the administrator just updates the static file root).

=item mc_file_root ()

Returns the static file root, used by mc_file() to resolve relative
filenames.

=item mc_out (string)

Print the given string. Rarely needed, since normally all HTML is just
placed in the component body and output implicitly. mc_out is useful
if you need to output something in the middle of a Perl block.

mc_out() should be favored over the lower-level C<$r-E<gt>print>,
since mc_out() may be redirected or buffered, depending on the
current state of the interpreter.

=item mc_time ()

Returns the interpreter's notion of the current time in Perl time()
format (number of seconds since the epoch).

To allow time and date simulations in the previewer, components should
use mc_time() rather than calling time() directly.

=head2 Web-only Commands

The following commands are only available when Mason is running in a
Web environment.

=over

=item mc_dhandler_arg ()

For use in dhandlers. Returns the path_info CGI argument, stripped of
its leading slash.

=item mc_suppress_http_header (0|1)

Mason normally emits any pending HTTP headers just before entering
the primary section of a component. To prevent this, call
mc_suppress_http_header(1) somewhere in the C<E<lt>%perl_init%E<gt>>
block. You can call mc_suppress_http_header(0) to cancel.
