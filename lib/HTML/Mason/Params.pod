=head1 NAME

HTML::Mason::Params - Constructor parameter documentation

=head1 DESCRIPTION

Mason has a lot of objects, most of which accept parameters when
passed to their constructor.  However, since most Mason objects are
made by other Mason objects, rather than by end users, Mason has been
designed so that when one object contains another, the container
object can accept constructor params not only for itself, but also for
any of its contained objects.

This means that typically, you simply make a top level object such as
an ApacheHandler or Interp object, and pass it whatever parameters you
want to set for any Mason object.

Of course, many people simply configure Mason via their httpd.conf
file, and don't ever make a Mason object.

This document lists B<all> of the Mason parameters are intended to be
used by end users.
